							<p>This calendar contains 12 original monster creations illustrated in collaboration with artist Chris Sandlin (SockMonkee). It measures 6"(w) x 12.5"(h) when hanging and easily fits in an office or desk area. Each calendar contains a regal clip weight that keeps the bottom pages together and weighs the calendar down when hanging. 2012 moon phases are included (half, full, and new) and it also has a yearly list of Holidays with dates for easy reference. It is screenprinted in a limited edition of 200. </p>
							<p>This project has been in the oven for quite some time now. Chris and I started hashing these characters out in the middle of August 2011. After flipping a coin to determine what months we were responsible for, we traded off monster drafts from week to week trying to match themes with our characters in fun ways. I think right off the bat we both hit up the easy months like October and January. New Years seemed like a no-brainer and nothing really compares to Halloween for October.</p>
							<p>The calendar is a duplexed booklet of 7 sheets. Which means that none of the pages make sense when you are printing them until the pages are put together and saddle stitched (like when you inbooklet something). This meant I had to make absolutely positive at every step of the way that the sheets had the correct monsters on the back of them AND they were facing the correct direction AND aligned to the correct side of the paper. Then to make matters worse, separations had to manually include creep for trimming the bottom edge. This coincidentally made all the pages look gradually more incorrect as the printing got closer to the middle of the booklet.</p>
